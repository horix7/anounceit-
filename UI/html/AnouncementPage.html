    Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help xhr.spec.whatwg.org – jeet.chanchawat Feb 24 '17 at 11:12
Since you are doing a synchronized call, you need to call xhttp.open("POST", "Your Rest URL Here", false);, otherwise xhttp.responseText will not contain the result. But as said before, it will be soon deprecated. – Alexandre Fenyo Jan 31 '18 at 9:39 
If this is a POST request, where are you actually posting the data? – EFC May 15 '18 at 18:47
"xhttp.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/json");" — This is a lie. You aren't passing any JSON to the send() method. – Quentin Jul 10 '18 at 13:44 
You've edited this code so the request is no longer syncronous, but you are trying to read the response as if it were. – Quentin Jul 10 '18 at 13:45
